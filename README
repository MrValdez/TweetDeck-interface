This is code that I worked on during the Code Retreat on Dec 3, 2011. This was done in a timespan of around 5 hours.

This code will launch TweetDeck and send a tweet. If TweetDeck is already running, it'll just use that instance.

I don't recommend using this code except for educational purposes. There are more elegant ways of sending a tweet instead of this horrifying idea.
